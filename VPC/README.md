For a public subnet to have Internet access, inbound and outbound, an account needs:
	• Internet Gateway attached to a VPC
	• Route to the Internet Gateway in the attached route table
	• Instances have public IP addresses (auto-assigned or attached Elastic IP address)
	• Appropriate security group and NACL allowances
	
For a private subnet to have Internet access, the following will provide outbound Internet access but not inbound:
	• Internet Gateway attached to a VPC
	• NAT Gateway or Instance in a public subnet in the same VPC
	• Route to the NAT Gateway or Instance in the private subnet’s attached route table
